First, run 

perl ConvertSequenceIntoListOfProtospacers.pl -i input 

This will convert a sequence presented in the input file into an outputfile named input.protospacers that contains a list of all CRISPR target sites found, in this case adhering to the NNG rule, and all target sites with an identical 20nt specificity. This is then used in a bowtie command to find how often any of those sequences are present in the genome:

/media/Data/iKRUNC/bowtie2-2.1.0/bowtie2 /media/Data/iKRUNC/hg19-index/hg19 -r input.protospacers -t -S input.matched --no-hd --score-min L,-5,0 -k 2

This list is then looked at to determine if any of the original N22G sites found in input are present more than once in the genome:

perl IdentifyIdenticalTargetSites.pl -i input.matched -o input.qualities

This script prints on screen those sites that have more than one match in the genome and will output the rest to the input.qualities file
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i exon2.qualities -o exon2.qualities.1 -d 1 -s 20 -l (-l=skip looking at results from previous run)
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i exon2.qualities.1 -o exon2.qualities.2 -d 2 -s 20 
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i exon2.qualities.2 -o exon2.qualities.3 -d 3 -s 20 
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i exon2.qualities.3 -o exon2.qualities.4 -d 4 -s 20
