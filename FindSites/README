These scripts are designed to create a large list of random 20-mers and then to count how many CRISPR target sites the genome contains for each of the 20-mers
To make a list of random 20-mers, change CreateRandomTargetList.pl according to the correct number of 20-mers wanted and run:
perl CreateRandomTargetList.pl -output=foo

This creates foo
Then run 
perl AddNGGToTargetList.pl -input=foo

This creates foo.potentialtargets, a list of all possible 23 nt target sites in the genome.
Then run
/media/Data/iKRUNC/bowtie2-2.1.0/bowtie2 /media/Data/iKRUNC/hg19-index/hg19 -r foo.potentialtargets -t -S foo.potentialtargets.matched --no-hd --score-min L,-5,0 -p 64

This will create foo.potentialtargets.matched, which is the output of matching all potential targets to the genome
Next, run
perl CountUniqueTargetOccurrence.pl -input=foo.potentialtargets.matched

This will create
	foo.potentialtargets.matched.out	=>	A List of all sites in the genome found corresponding to a certain 20-mer. The last column indicates whether the found position is within a gene
	foo.potentialtargets.matched.counts	=>	A list of all 20-mers along with how many valid CRISPR sites (NGG) they have in the genome and how many of those are within genes. Only 20-mers with 1 or more hits are reported.

Start analyzing off-target sites
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i foo.potentialtargets.matched.out -o foo.qualities.1 -d 1 -s 20 -l
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i foo.qualities.1 -o foo.qualities.2 -d 2 -s 20 
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i foo.qualities.2 -o foo.qualities.3 -d 3 -s 20 
perl QualityScoreSites.pl -i foo.qualities.3 -o foo.qualities.4 -d 4 -s 20
