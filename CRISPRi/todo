To select the best CRISPRs against any gene, do the following:

-Initially, only look at CRISPRs with no 1MM off-target effects. Only look at 20nt CRISPRs.
-For every transcript, try to select 5 gRNAs that are between +25 and +100 of their TSS.
-If more are present, take those with the least # of expected off-target effects
-Choose gRNAs up to 10 without TSS proximity restrictions, taking those with the least # of expected off-target effects
-Consolidate multiple occurring gRNAs
-If there are more than 18 gRNAs targeting a gene, perform at least 3 picking rounds starting from the top of the list of every transcript. If <18 gRNAs result, continue until reaching 18 gRNAs.
-If <10 gRNAs are found for a gene, redo the whole procedure also including 1MM off-target gRNAs and add them from top to bottom until 10 are reached.
